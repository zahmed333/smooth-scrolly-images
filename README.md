# Project: Dynamic Glitch Text Effect

## Overview
This project demonstrates a dynamic glitch text effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary feature is a glitch effect applied to the text "Surveillance", which remains fixed in the center of the viewport as the user scrolls through images.

## Features
- **Fixed Glitch Text**: The text "Surveillance" displays with a glitch animation and remains centered and fixed on the screen regardless of scrolling.
- **Scrolling Images**: Multiple images are set in a grid format and scrollable, sitting behind the fixed glitch text.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the glitch text and images are properly scaled and displayed across different device sizes.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage including the glitch text and a series of images.
- `style.css`: Styles the glitch effect, the fixed positioning of the text, and the layout of the images.
- `script.js`: Contains JavaScript for enhancing the interactivity of the webpage, primarily handling smooth scrolling and glitch text animation.
